# Goal
The goal of this repository is to gather all kind of the fundamental algorithms that we use today. For example, think about all the Machine Learning applications which are part our daily lives (e.g. recommender systems, face recognition, sound detection, email spam, fraud detection and so on). This repository show us all the building block of this amazing applications.
